ca ypu exaplin whta the diference betwen this becusse they kinda looks the same The Major Types of Non-Stationary Processes1. Trend Non-Stationarity (Deterministic Trend)This is the "Moving Target" I mentioned earlier. The average value (the mean) of the process shifts in a predictable way over time.The Model:$$X_t = \text{Randomness} + \text{Trend}$$(Example: $X_t = \text{Randomness} + c \cdot t$)$c$ is a constant drift rate.The mean is clearly dependent on time ($t$).Why the Histogram Fails: The entire distribution (the whole histogram) is being pushed to the right (or left) over time. If you take a sample across a long time period, the histogram becomes a long, wide smear that never looks like a small, stable hill.Analogy: The price of a candy bar increasing by a fixed amount (inflation) every year.2. Difference Non-Stationarity (Stochastic Trend)This is the Random Walk you identified:$$X_t = X_{t-1} + \text{Randomness}$$The Model:$$X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{t} \text{Randomness}_i$$The process has memory and is the sum of all past random shocks.Why the Histogram Fails: The variance (the spread) of the data grows larger as time goes on. The process wanders further and further away from its starting point. If you plot a histogram of a long time period, it will be much wider and flatter than a histogram from a short time period. The shape itself is unstable.Analogy: A drunkard walking away from a lamp post. The longer he walks, the further he gets, and the wider the possible area he could be in.3. Seasonal Non-StationarityThis is when the process exhibits a repeating pattern (a cycle) over a fixed, known period (like a year, a week, or a day).The Model: The mean value changes based on the season $S_t$.$$X_t = \text{Randomness} + S_t$$Why the Histogram Fails: Imagine taking a sample of the outdoor temperature throughout a year. The histogram of the entire year would be a wide distribution. But if you took a sample of just July, the histogram would be a narrow bump shifted to the right (hot). The overall histogram is not stable because the process is structured around a cycle.Analogy: Electricity usage is high at 7 PM and low at 3 AM every day.4. Variance Non-Stationarity (Heteroskedasticity)In this case, the average (mean) stays stable (it doesn't drift), but the level of randomness (the volatility) changes over time.The Model: The expected magnitude of the error (or volatility $\sigma^2$) is dependent on time.$$\text{Variance of } X_t = \sigma_t^2$$Why the Histogram Fails: A histogram of a time period with low volatility (calm) would be a tall, thin peak. A histogram of a time period with high volatility (turbulent) would be a short, fat peak. If you combine these two samples, the resulting histogram is a mix that is dependent on how much quiet time versus how much volatile time you included. The shape is unstable.
